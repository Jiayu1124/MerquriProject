If you use the same PreAuthorize configuration on each method in a class, how can you
make the annotations cleaner?


I will declare a custom annotation that encapsulates the @PreAuthorize annotation. For example 


There is a preauthorize role "ROLE_VIEWER"

I can declare a custom annotation "ViewerOnly" that is using the "ROLE_VIEWER"

@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_VIEWER')")
public @interface ViewerOnly {
}


Therefore, I can use the custom annotation instead of using the pre-authorization code to ensure
annotation is only define at "ViewerOnly" class.
